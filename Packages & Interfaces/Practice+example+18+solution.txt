Create an interface named BankRules
Create a file named BankRules.java
package com.company;

interface BankRules{


   void interest_paid();

}


Create a new class called private bank
public class Privatebank {

   String customer_name;

   Privatebank(String customer_name){
       this.customer_name = customer_name;

   }
 }
}


Create a new class called government bank
public class Govtbank implements BankRules {

   String customer_name;

   Govtbank(String customer_name){
       this.customer_name = customer_name;

   }
  }


Make both class implement BankRules
Add the interest_paid methods to them

For private bank
public void interest_paid() {
   System.out.println(this.customer_name +"is paid an interest of 5%");
}

For government bank
public void interest_paid() {
   System.out.println(this.customer_name+" is paid an interest of 7%");
}
Now create the objects in the main class for both private bank and government bank customer:
Privatebank pb = new Privatebank("John");
pb.interest_paid();

Govtbank gb = new Govtbank("Rob");
gb.interest_paid();
